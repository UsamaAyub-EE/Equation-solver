# Equation-solver
The program is capable of solving upto 5 linear equations in 5 variables. It makes use of Crammar's rule. 
The program prints the solution as fractions instead of floating point numbers and uses integers to reach 
the solution, to ensure that no loss of data occurs when floating point numbers are rounded off.
